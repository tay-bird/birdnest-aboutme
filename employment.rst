Demonware: Systems Administrator
--------------------------------

:When:

    April 2015 - March 2016

:What:

    As a Systems Administrator, I was tasked with constantly reviewing the state
    of Demonware's infrastructure. I looked for indicators of issues that may detract
    from a gamerâ€™s experience, degrade Demonware's services, or present an issue for
    our development units. I would then resolve them myself or coordinate other teams
    during major service incidents.

    In addition to my primary responsibility for the health of Demonware's
    infrastructure, I am also responsible for general administrative tasks during
    any free time including configuring hosts and clusters, creating or improving
    Nagios checks, coordinating remote maintenance tasks and writing incident
    reports.

:Stats:

    In 2015, I raised 334 hardware/service alerts and resolved 306 of them. I
    completed roughly 98 administrative assignments and responded to approximately
    36 major incidents.

Stytch: Cloud Operations Engineer

:When:

    March 2016 - Ongoing

:What:

    I am currently the sole Operations Engineer at Stytch. I am responsible for
    the configuration, deployment, and monitoring of our cloud-based infrastructure.
    This includes product launch and upgrades, continuous integration systems, and
    troubleshooting of production and development environments. I also contribute
    regularly to the development of a number of in-house orchestration tools,
    primarily written in Python.


Demonware: NOC Tools Team
-------------------------

:When:

    November 2015 - March 2016

:What:

    As a member of the NOC Tools Team, I was tasked with the development and
    maintenance of automation software. I planned, developed, and maintained two
    internal services at Demonware: :ref:`Neversleep` and :ref:`Jarvis`. I also
    wrote numerous scripts on request from team members to produce weekly management
    reports, manage Google Calendar events, create and update JIRA tickets, and other
    routine tasks.

:Stats:

    In 2015, I made 825 commits (+98 200 additions, -25 000 deletions).
