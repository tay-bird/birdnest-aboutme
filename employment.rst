Stytch: Cloud Operations Engineer
---------------------------------

:When:

    March 2016 - September 2016

:What:

    During my time at Stytch as a Cloud Operations Engineer, I oversaw the configuration, 
    deployment, and monitoring of our cloud-based infrastructure. I was responsible for
    product launch and upgrades, continuous integration systems, and troubleshooting of
    production and development environments.
    
    I also contributed regularly to the development of a number of in-house orchestration
    tools; provided education on cloud infrastructure to my co-workers; provided
    support for internal services such as Slack; and served as Scrum Master for Stytch's Java
    platform development team.

    I gave an interview about my work at Stytch to DevOps.com in August 2016, available
    `here <https://devops.com/stytch-case-study-devops-culture-tools/>`_.

:Notes:

    * Built and maintained an internal toolset that enabled our feature delivery teams to manage
      their own cloud infrastructure at a highly abstract level.
    * Planned and delivered a series of “Failure Friday” incident training sessions to our team of
      20 developers.


Demonware: Systems Administrator
--------------------------------

:When:

    April 2015 - March 2016

:What:

    As a Systems Administrator, I was tasked with constantly reviewing the state
    of Demonware's infrastructure. I looked for indicators of issues that may detract
    from a gamer’s experience, degrade Demonware's services, or present an issue for
    our development units. I would then resolve them myself or coordinate other teams
    during major service incidents.

    In addition to my primary responsibility for the health of Demonware's
    infrastructure, I was also responsible for general administrative tasks during
    any free time including configuring hosts and clusters, creating or improving
    Nagios checks, coordinating remote maintenance tasks and writing incident
    reports.

    I was also tasked with the development of small automation tools. I planned,
    built, and maintained two internal services at Demonware: :ref:`Neversleep` and
    :ref:`Jarvis`. I also wrote numerous scripts on request for team members to
    produce reports, manage Google Calendar events, and track JIRA tickets.
