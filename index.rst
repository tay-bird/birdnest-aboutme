Employment
==========

Stytch: Cloud Operations Engineer
---------------------------------

:When:

    March 2016 - Ongoing

:What:

    I am currently the sole Operations Engineer at Stytch. I am responsible for
    the configuration, deployment, and monitoring of our cloud-based infrastructure.
    This includes product launch and upgrades, continuous integration systems, and
    troubleshooting of production and development environments. I also contribute
    regularly to the development of a number of in-house orchestration tools,
    primarily written in Python.

Demonware NOC: SysAdmin
-----------------------

:When:

    April 2015 - March 2016

:What:

    As a NOC SysAdmin, I am tasked with constantly reviewing the state of our
    infrastructure looking for indicators of an issue that may detract from a
    gamerâ€™s experience, degrade Demonware's services, or present an issue for
    our development units. I then take action on these incidents.

    In addition to my primary responsibility for the health of Demonware's
    infrastructure, I am also responsible for general administrative tasks during
    any free time including configuring hosts and clusters, creating or improving
    Nagios checks, coordinating remote maintenance tasks and writing incident
    reports.

:Stats:

    In 2015, I raised 334 hardware/service alerts and resolved 306 of them. I
    completed roughly 98 administrative assignments and responded to approximately
    36 major incidents.

Demonware NOC: Tools Team
-------------------------

:When:

    November 2015 - March 2016

:What:

    As a member of the NOC Tools Team, I am responsible for the development and
    maintenance of automation solutions. I work in cooperation with three
    excellent coworkers towards the common goal of automating ourselves out of
    our NOC SysAdmin positions.
    
    I planned, developed, and maintained two internal services at Demonware:
    `Neversleep`_ and `Jarvis`_. I also have a number of small scripts to my
    name that produce weekly management reports, manage Google Calendar events,
    create and update JIRA tickets, and other routine tasks.

:Stats:

    In 2015, I made 825 commits (+98 200 additions, -25 000 deletions).

Projects
========

.. _Neversleep:

Neversleep
----------

:When:

    June 2015 - March 2016

:What:

    Neversleep is a ChatOps platform used at Demonware. It provides a dynamic
    framework for developing plugins that interact with end users over Jabber (XMPP).

    I developed Neversleep as a probation project shortly after I joined Demonware.
    Since then, I have iterated hundreds of times on the core framework to produce
    a robust, reliable, and well used ChatOps service.

.. _Jarvis:

Jarvis
------
    
:When:

    October 2015 - March 2016

:What:

    Jarvis is a framework used at Demonware for data aggregation and analysis.
    It watches for certain events or event patterns and generates email reports
    in response.

    I planned and developed Jarvis with a small team. We produced this
    service within the NOC department to provide other teams with a framework for
    gathering, analyzing, and responding to a wide range of system metrics.
