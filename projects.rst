Projects
========

.. _Hotswappy:

Hotswappy
---------

Hotswappy is a proof-of-concept I put together over a weekend. It provides a plugin
manager that allows a running service to reload Python modules from source. It can be
found on `Github <https://github.com/tay-bird/hotswappy>`_. Documentation is available
on `Github Pages <https://tay-bird.github.io/hotswappy/>`_.

.. _Neversleep:

Neversleep
----------

Neversleep is a ChatOps platform used at Demonware. It provides a dynamic
framework for developing plugins that interact with end users over Jabber (XMPP).

I developed Neversleep as a probation project shortly after I joined Demonware
and continued to improve it throughout my time there. The core framework is now
a robust, reliable, and well used ChatOps service.

.. _Jarvis:

Jarvis
------

Jarvis is a framework used at Demonware for data aggregation and analysis.
It watches for certain events or event patterns and generates email reports
in response.

I planned and developed Jarvis with a small team. We produced this
service within the NOC department to provide other teams with a framework for
gathering, analyzing, and responding to a wide range of system metrics.

.. _Birdnest:

Birdnest is my current web presense at `taybird.com <https://taybird.com>`_
(`Github <https://github.com/tay-bird/birdnest-web>`_) and
`taybird.com/aboutme <https://taybird.com/aboutme>`_ 
(`Github <https://github.com/tay-bird/birdnest-aboutme>`_). I've tried to keep
my home page as light as possible, just a single route in Flask with very light
html and css. The document you're currently reading is restructured text built
with Sphinx on `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/tay-bird/birdnest-aboutme>`_.

.. _Skybird:

Skybird
-------

Skybird is a lightweight cloud service for personal servers. It provides an 
email and calendar interface, file management, and server statistics dashboards.
Skybird can be run locally, or through Apache with WSGI.

I worked on this project in late 2014 to try my hand web development and hosting,
database administration, and user authentication with OAuth. The source code is
available on `Github <https://github.com/tay-bird/skybird>`_.
