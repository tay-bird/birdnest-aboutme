Projects
========

Tool Garden
-----------

.. _Tool Garden:

Tool Garden was an internal Python library at Stytch that supplemented Boto to
deploy new applications and infrastructure. I worked on this project along with
two other engineers at Stytch.

Tool Garden was not a remarkable project. However, it was still a valuable
experience for me. This was my first full-time software development
project and my first time doing a major collaboration with another engineer.
Additionally, it forced me to learn many new tools and processes: automated
tests, staged deployments, api doc generation, and dependency management.

.. _Hotswappy:

Hotswappy
---------

Hotswappy is a proof-of-concept I put together over a weekend in Spring 2016. It
provides a plugin manager that allows a running service to reload Python modules
from source. It can be found on `Github <https://github.com/tay-bird/hotswappy>`_.
Documentation is available on `Github Pages <https://tay-bird.github.io/hotswappy/>`_.

.. _Neversleep:

Neversleep
----------

Neversleep eas a ChatOps platform I developed at Demonware. It provided a dynamic
framework for developing plugins that could interact with end users over Jabber.

I developed Neversleep as an onboarding project shortly after I joined Demonware
and continued to improve it throughout my time there. By the time I left, the core
framework had matured into a robust, reliable, and well used internal ChatOps service.

.. _Jarvis:

Jarvis
------

Jarvis was a monitoring framework used at Demonware for data aggregation and analysis.
It watched for certain events or event patterns and generated email reports
in response.

I produced this service with another engineer in the NOC department to provide other
teams with a framework for gathering, analyzing, and responding to a wide range
of system metrics.

.. _Birdnest:

Birdnest
--------

Birdnest is my current web presense at `taybird.com <https://taybird.com>`_
(`Github <https://github.com/tay-bird/birdnest-web>`_) and
`taybird.com/aboutme <https://taybird.com/aboutme>`_ 
(`Github <https://github.com/tay-bird/birdnest-aboutme>`_). On the backend,
Birdnest is a `Flask project <https://github.com/tay-bird/birdnest>`_ hosted
on an AWS EC2 instance and proxying two AWS S3 buckets.

The document you're currently reading is restructured text built
with Sphinx on `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/tay-bird/birdnest-aboutme>`_.

.. _Skybird:

Skybird
-------

Skybird is a lightweight cloud service for personal servers. It provides an 
email and calendar interface, file management, and server statistics dashboards.
Skybird can be run locally, or through Apache with WSGI.

I worked on this project in late 2014 to try my hand web development and hosting,
database administration, and user authentication with OAuth. The source code is
available on `Github <https://github.com/tay-bird/skybird>`_.
