.. _Neversleep:

Neversleep
----------

:When:

    June 2015 - March 2016

:What:

    Neversleep is a ChatOps platform used at Demonware. It provides a dynamic
    framework for developing plugins that interact with end users over Jabber (XMPP).

    I developed Neversleep as a probation project shortly after I joined Demonware.
    Since then, I have iterated hundreds of times on the core framework to produce
    a robust, reliable, and well used ChatOps service.

.. _Jarvis:

Jarvis
------
    
:When:

    October 2015 - March 2016

:What:

    Jarvis is a framework used at Demonware for data aggregation and analysis.
    It watches for certain events or event patterns and generates email reports
    in response.

    I planned and developed Jarvis with a small team. We produced this
    service within the NOC department to provide other teams with a framework for
    gathering, analyzing, and responding to a wide range of system metrics.
