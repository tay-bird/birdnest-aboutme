.. _Tool Garden:

Tool Garden
-----------

Tool Garden was an internal Python library at Stytch that supplemented Boto to
deploy new applications and infrastructure. I worked on this project along with
two other engineers at Stytch.

Tool Garden was not a remarkable project. However, it was still a valuable
experience for me. This was my first full-time software development
project and my first time doing a major collaboration with another engineer.
Additionally, it forced me to learn many new tools and processes: automated
tests, staged deployments, api doc generation, and dependency management.

.. _Neversleep:

Neversleep
----------

Neversleep was a ChatOps platform I developed at Demonware. It provided a dynamic
framework for developing plugins that could interact with end users over Jabber.

I developed Neversleep as an onboarding project shortly after I joined Demonware
and continued to improve it throughout my time there. By the time I left, the core
framework had matured into a robust, reliable, and well used internal ChatOps service.

.. _Jarvis:

Jarvis
------

Jarvis was a monitoring framework used at Demonware for data aggregation and analysis.
It watched for certain events or event patterns and generated email reports
in response.

I produced this service with another engineer in the NOC department to provide other
teams with a framework for gathering, analyzing, and responding to a wide range
of system metrics.
